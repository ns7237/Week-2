* Week 2: Object-Oriented Programming in Java
Welcome to Week 2 of our Java learning journey. This week focused on diving deep into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and how they are implemented in Java.

* Overview
This week built on Java basics by introducing core OOP concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism. You’ll learn how to model real-world problems using Java classes and understand how Java enforces structure and behavior in OOP design.

* Topics Covered
* Day 1: OOP Fundamentals
What is Object-Oriented Programming?

Key OOP concepts: Class, Object, Method, Attribute

Principles: Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism

Benefits of using OOP

* Day 2: Constructors, Variables, Access Modifiers
Understanding constructors (default, parameterized)

Difference between instance and class (static) variables

Access modifiers: public, private, protected, default

Best practices for variable and constructor usage

* Day 3: this, static, final, and instanceof
this keyword and its usage in constructors and methods

static keyword in context of variables and methods

final keyword for variables, methods, and classes

instanceof operator to test object types

* Day 4: Object Modeling and Class Diagrams
Real-world object modeling using classes and attributes

UML Class Diagrams (Unified Modeling Language)

Representing relationships: association, aggregation, composition

* Day 5: Inheritance
Concept of inheritance and code reusability

extends keyword and method overriding

Use of super keyword

Multilevel and hierarchical inheritance

* Day 6: Encapsulation, Interfaces, Abstract Classes & Polymorphism
Encapsulation: Using private fields and public getters/setters

Interfaces: Defining contracts in Java (implements)

Abstract Classes: Partial implementation (abstract keyword)

Polymorphism: Compile-time and run-time polymorphism

Use of @Override annotation

* Prerequisites
Java basics (variables, methods, control flow, arrays)

JDK installed

Any IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code

* How to Use This Repository
Each day’s materials are organized into folders containing:
